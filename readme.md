Change the configuration to have the bot function how you need it.

## Install Guide


1. Create a new application in the [Discord Developer Portal][DiscordDeveloperPortal]!
 
2. Go to the bot section of the application and create a new bot. Don't forget to pick a neat name for him!
 
3. Copy the bot's token and paste it into the configuration's `"token": ""` part.
 
4. In the configuration file select the prefix that is not used with other bots in the `"prefix": ""` part.


That's it! You just need to run the bot.py file and you are now running Discord-jsbot! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
